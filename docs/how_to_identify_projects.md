# How to Identify Open Source Projects in Sustainability and Climate

This document outlines a methodology for identifying relevant open-source projects in the areas of sustainability and climate, building upon the existing efforts of the Open Sustainable Technology initiative.

## 1. Understanding the Scope and Principles

Before beginning the search, it is crucial to understand the core principles and criteria for project inclusion as defined by OpenSustain.tech. Projects should:

*   Align with the [Open Sustainability Principles](https://opensustain.tech/principles/).
*   Be instrumental in preserving/restoring natural ecosystems, supporting climate change mitigation/adaptation, or enabling environmental sustainability through open technology, methods, data, knowledge, intelligence, or tools.
*   Be actively used or developed by others outside the core project or organization.
*   Be structured and documented for maintenance, reuse, and extendability.
*   Be published under an open-source license.

## 2. Leveraging Keyword-Based Search

The `ost_keywords.txt` file provides a valuable starting point with a list of terms frequently associated with open-source projects in this domain. These keywords can be used to formulate targeted search queries across various platforms.

**Example Keywords (from `ost_keywords.txt`):
**
*   `mass`, `content`, `concentration`, `radioactivity`, `atmosphere`, `water`, `carbon`, `energy`, `climate`, `biodiversity`, `renewable energy`, `solar`, `wind`, `hydrology`, `emissions`, `pollution`, `deforestation`, `conservation`, `sustainable development`.

**Search Platforms:**

*   **GitHub:** Utilize advanced search filters to combine keywords with programming languages (e.g., `python`, `R`, `Java`) and repository characteristics (e.g., `stars:>100`, `forks:>50`, `updated:>2023-01-01`).
*   **GitLab, Bitbucket, Zenodo:** Extend searches to these platforms using similar keyword-based approaches.
*   **Academic Search Engines (e.g., Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar):** Search for research papers that mention open-source tools or datasets related to sustainability. Look for terms like "open-source software," "open data," "GitHub repository," in conjunction with sustainability keywords.
*   **Specialized Search Engines/Indexes:** Explore platforms like [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io/), [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), [rdrr.io](https://rdrr.io/) for package-level discovery.

## 3. Exploring Existing Networks and Communities

*   **Open Source Communities:** Engage with existing open-source communities focused on environmental science, climate change, or sustainable technology. Forums, mailing lists, and social media groups can be excellent sources for discovering new projects.
*   **Conferences and Workshops:** Attend virtual or in-person conferences and workshops related to AI/ML for sustainability. Projects are often presented and discussed at these events.
*   **Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS):** Regularly review publications in JOSS for newly published open-source research software relevant to the domain.
*   **Crowdsourcing and Interviews:** As highlighted in the OpenSustain.tech methodology report, direct engagement with domain experts and practitioners through interviews or crowdsourcing initiatives can uncover valuable projects not easily found through automated means.

## 4. Analyzing Project Suitability

Once potential projects are identified, evaluate them against the OpenSustain.tech criteria. Pay close attention to:

*   **Active Development:** Check commit history, recent pull requests, and issue activity.
*   **Community Engagement:** Look for signs of external contributions, active discussions, and responsiveness from maintainers.
*   **Documentation:** Assess the clarity and completeness of project documentation, including installation guides, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.
*   **Licensing:** Verify that the project is released under a recognized open-source license.

## 5. Contributing to the Open Sustainable Technology Database

For any newly identified projects that meet the criteria, follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/protontypes/open-sustainable-technology/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to add them to the Open Sustainable Technology database via a pull request. Ensure to provide all necessary details and a clear description of the project's relevance to sustainability.

By following this comprehensive approach, we can collectively enhance the visibility and impact of open-source projects driving environmental sustainability.
