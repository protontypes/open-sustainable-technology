# Contribution Guide

## Fast Lane
If you just want to give a hint about a missing project, send an email at [tobias.augspurger@protontypes.eu](mailto:tobias.augspurger@protontypes.eu). However, we would be pleased to add you to the list of official contributors via a pull request. 

## Guideline
> _Earth's uniqueness in creating a stable environment for life in a completely hostile space is a miracle. Various life forms have taken billions of years to build up the natural resources humans depend on, such as a protective atmosphere, fertile soil, stable weather, and clean drinking water. As a movement to democratize technology development and knowledge creation, open source has the potential to become the central driver in preserving this stability. Open Sustainable Technology's mission is to gather projects that preserve natural ecosystems through open technology, methods, data, intelligence, knowledge or tools._
