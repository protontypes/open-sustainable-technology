It\u2019s been four years since the Open Sustainable Technology project kicked off. At the time, most of the R&amp;D team I\u2019d built up over the previous five years had been fired from DHL/Streetscooter. To give back to the robotics community, we released the Awesome Robotic Tooling list of the best tools for the various autonomous and electric trucks that we built. But how to continue on this path of free and collaborative innovation that I came to love over the years? I decided to shift my career to focus on open technology\u2019s potential for positive long-term impact.</p> OpenSustain.tech landing page <p>To my surprise, no one had yet compiled a comprehensive overview of Open Source Software (OSS) around climate change and sustainability. Sure, there were a few lists on various sustainability topics, but most of them were not updated or only represented a tiny part of this OSS ecosystem.</p> <p>Thanks to the pandemic, my unemployment and the support of friends, the team published early results in September 2021. The feedback was overwhelming. We realized that almost no one had a good understanding of what Open Source could do to help fight climate change and protect our natural world. And no one was talking about the crucial role Open Source was already playing. To this day, Open Sustainable Technology is one of the world\u2019s leading projects that scientifically analyses and advocates how open methods can accelerate a sustainable transition. The fact that a community-based project with no funding and just a few volunteers could archive this was both shocking and motivating at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"blog/closing-the-gap/#understanding-natural-dynamics-in-open-source","title":"Understanding natural dynamics in Open Source","text":"<p>Typically, OSS ecosystems are created from a user perspective, based on the infrastructure being used, or as part of a larger technical framework or programming language. Few tried to map OSS ecosystems based on common real-world applications and issues. I regularly heard that our approach was crazy and technically unfeasible given the number of projects in the field. Since I was also starting a PhD in Atmospheric Science, I was able to leverage my studies to continue curating strong research projects in the field around the world for fun.</p> <p>When the attention started to fade and most of the supporting contributors started working on other projects, an efficient way of deciding whether a project is worth listing or not was needed. The challenge with climate and sustainability projects is to filter out relevant projects from the noise. Which project can be reused and create added value for other OSS projects and developers? So instead of judging the quality of a project and its source code, I focused on external usage indicators like download numbers and issues from users outside of the projects.</p> <p>My studies, previous work experience and various glossaries helped me find the relevant keywords. Clouds, for example, provide one of the most difficult aspects of climate forecasting, but it\u2019s almost impossible to find relevant projects because they\u2019re buried under a mass of cloud computing. The same goes for terms like ocean, sea, environment, atmosphere, battery and carbon.</p> <p>\u201cThe OSS community has a hard time gathering around relevant topics because they cannot find each other and are forced to reinvent the wheel over and over again. I\u2019m still convinced that the main problem with OSS sustainability is the lack of a comprehensive search engine to help you find the right (active and documented) projects for your use case.\u201d</p> <p>A year into the project, I started to lose motivation. It\u2019s a shame to see how many projects in this area don\u2019t get any further development after their release, even if you see how hard they try to build community. I estimate that more than 95% of the thousands of repositories I reviewed are now inactive. Research in this area is incredibly exciting due to the diverse technologies and methods employed, but it also underscores the pressing nature of many environmental challenges. What kept me going was the unique insight I was able to create for myself and others. There\u2019s a huge, untapped potential for OSS to make an impact on climate and biodiversity. This potential extends beyond scientific research to business practices and systemic changes for a sustainable future.</p> <p>Openness about environmental models, data and statements is the most important indicator of genuine sustainability efforts. The very nature of environmental sustainability demands such openness: Our planet is simply too complex to argue with black boxes. Explaining, planning and forecasting requires a way to iterate in the open to improve assumptions and models over the long term.</p>"},{"location":"blog/closing-the-gap/#first-insights","title":"First insights","text":"<p>The database already showed clear trends, such as the lack of companies and for-profits. It also became clear that where traceable numbers are bad for business as usual, OSS and open science play a tiny role, even though software and high-quality numbers are highly relevant. So far, these include in particular carbon offsets, anything related to corporate \u2018climate neutrality,\u2019 corporate emissions, sustainable investment and carbon capture. As part of this \u2018gap\u2019 analysis, it\u2019s clear that there is no existing open-source climate model with verifiable scientific data that can refute the claim of long-term environmental destruction caused by climate change. However, there are a variety of smaller and larger, along with their supporting data, that reinforce this alarming trend.</p> <p>I started writing blog posts about the findings, e.g. about the lack of OSS in sustainable investment and how this relates to the lack of reproducibility of collaborative sustainability ratings. To my surprise, these reached hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. After seeing how easy it was to innovate and create climate action with OSS, I kept giving talks and writing articles to motivate others. That said, I still don\u2019t understand why the \u201cOpen Source Way\u201d is so little understood, promoted and propagated in the climate and sustainability community. Accurate and transparent quantification of a technology\u2019s sustainability can help mitigate the uncertainty caused by political manipulation and lobbying.

Without her help and the refreshed motivation, the project might have been abandoned. The two of us bolstered each other to write the first report on The Open Source Sustainability Ecosystem, with Josh Hopkins joining later on.</p> <p>Fortunately, at the beginning of the project, we decided to focus on Git repositories. This allowed us to retrieve metadata about the projects and organizations using the APIs of the Git platforms. We also found Open Source ecosystem analysis in general to be a fascinating new scientific field. Introducing a new health indicator, like the Development Distribution Score, allowed us to get a first impression of the community. As in a natural ecosystem, we can study similar quantities such as diversity of topics, organizational structures, global distribution and how these projects can be \u2018preserved\u2019.</p> <p>At one of the conferences presenting our findings, met Andrew Nesbitt of Ecosyste.ms. With his help, the analysis jumped to the next level. Download numbers from almost all package managers and citations of projects based on their DOI (Digital Object Identifier) were added to the metadata. Linking Open Source repositories to articles and papers using the DOI, which is available for a growing number of scientific projects, has greatly increased the amount of data available. Citations can be used to gauge the relevance of a project. More automation and various methods such as embedding, unearthed hundreds of additional projects. In addition to some online marketing for the ecosystem, we started to build some additional services for the projects collected, such as ClimateTriage.com, to help developers contribute and join an open-climate community.</p>"},{"location":"blog/closing-the-gap/#the-challenge-of-keeping-the-lights-on","title":"The challenge of keeping the lights on","text":"<p>However, with over 1,000 organizations and 2,000 projects, it was becoming increasingly difficult to find new projects.

We also investigated how methods such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLM) could be applied to our dataset.</p> <p>The roadblock? We weren\u2019t able to find funding for this or most of our other work. Confession: This was largely my fault because I had avoided establishing a funding source and legal organization early on.

When examining ESG scoring in its current form, it becomes clear that robust\u00a0scientific approaches do not inform these \"measurements\".\u00a0Instead, companies produce ESG reports using a range of questionnaires\u00a0that vary significantly by industry. ESG rating agencies process these reports using a mix of manual and automated methods. For example, natural language processing algorithms, a subset of artificial intelligence, are used to process public media and sustainability reports to assess how \"green\" a company is behaving [8] [9]. ESG experts worldwide advocate for the standardisation of ESG reports and hope for guidance at European Union. [10]. However, since this is an empirical topic, one should rather look in the direction of science. </p> <p>Since the current methods of ESG ratings are also known to companies, they are trying to \"represent\" their own company, technology and business models as ecologically as possible to the outside world under all circumstances with the help of massiv green marketing. If you take a closer look at the algorithms and methods, you will see that ESG is used to determine the quality and quantity of green marketing campaigns. The following figure shows how such an assessment is created today using data-driven approaches. [11] </p> <p> </p>  Figure 3: A Data-driven Approach to Environmental, Social and Governance  <p>Independent scientific analyses and peer reviews of their own reports are the exception here. Each company designs its ESG reports at its own discretion. Also reports from the media are in the rarest cases purely objective nature and it is therefore very questionable to include them.

The complexity of scientific experiments has led to the so-called replication crisis [12]. New tools such as neutral networks and other very complex processing chains of data made scientific results very difficult for other scientists to replicate. The published papers were not sufficient to inform outsiders about the underlying data, instruments, methods, and steps. In many respects, this development is analogous to the reports on the impact of companies on their environment. </p> <p>In the field of climate science, but also in many other scientific fields, there has therefore been a fast transformation in recent years. The triumph of Open Science, Open Access, Open Data and Open Source can no longer be denied [13]. Satellite data, climate models, software tools and the associated programming languages are now open and freely available. Instead of arguing about the results of non-transparent studies, it is now possible to discuss scientific details of how the results were obtained.  However, as long as this is done according to open principles, discussions remain scientific, objective, and evidence-based. Thus, even the last doubts about the existence of climate change could be dispelled. Today there are no studies based on open principles, which are able to disprove the existence of climate change.</p> <p>Open Science and scientific discourse create reproducible knowledge. Open science communities like Pangeo represent prime examples of this field and show how Earth Science has been transformed by Open Source and Open Science. Emerging patforms like Papers with Code or Journal of Open Source Software created a new mindset on how knowledge can be published and reviewed in public. Within the energy modeling community, a key backbone of the energy transition, there is a strong trend toward open knowledge modeling.

Cary Krosinsky and the team of Real Impact Tracker released their methodology on GitHub with a blog post giving more background information [17] [18].

Like the previous example, this course includes tutorials to use Python, one of the main tools for climate scientists today. The textbook is a living document that has been created around climlab to provide a powerful but entry-level friendly tool for climate modeling.</p> <p> </p>  Figure 4: You can learn to make maps illustrating surface air temperature anomalies due to CO2 doubling  <p>Earth Lab provides Earth data science lessons that will help you learn how to work with data in the R and Python programming languages. All course material is open source. Nonspecialists who enroll in the Earth data analytics online course help ensure that understanding how the planet works is not just an academic exercise but also a field of knowledge used in all parts of society.</p>"},{"location":"blog/you_can_preserve_the_earth_s_livability_with_open_source/#observe-the-planet","title":"Observe the planet","text":"<p>Satellites provide a unique tool to map the state of the planet. Even small changes in our ecosystems such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use change, biodiversity loss, soil drought, or water pollution can be measured with high temporal and spatial resolution.. The data collected here are calibrated to the highest scientific standards and therefore provide an objective view of Earth. Recent years have seen a massive democratization of data and software tools in this field. NASA and ESA have published many data sets and tools from various satellite missions under a free license.</p> <p>The condition of even the most remote forests can be assessed with the help of satellite images in different spectra. All kinds of forest health indicators can be derived from data, like deforestation risk, wildfire risk, or tree detection. By using and improving these tools, you can actively contribute to preserving this ecosystem. Only by measuring and disclosing such information can environmentalists demonstrate that habitats are being lost.</p> <p>You can also learn how to process satellite data using modern image processing algorithms such as neural networks. One of the most robust communities in this field is Global Forest Watch. Here, multiple datasets are combined to give an interactive overview of the health of forests worldwide.</p> <p> </p>  Figure 5: Spatial probability of deforestation on Guadeloupe  <p>Projects like Resource Watch and Radiant Earth provide entry-level platforms for people anywhere to understand natural resources based on Earth-observation technology. NASA provides its own open source platform, NASA Harvest, to map the state of crops, providing essential information about food security. Another way to get insights about possible hunger crises is the measurement of soil moisture, which is also possible from space with packages like smapr.</p> <p>The ever-increasing resolution of satellite data in recent years means that even the impact of individual companies on the environment can be measured. This new field of science is called spatial finance, and its purpose is to guide business development and investment in alignment with good sustainability practices. The first open datasets in this field track the locations and  companies involved in cement production, iron and steel production, and global coal, oil, and gas supply chains. The Carbon Mapper platform shows how to build pressure on companies by disclosing methane and carbon dioxide sources.</p> <p> </p>  Figure 6: Global coal, oil, and gas asset-level data (Lucas Kruitwagen, MIT License)"},{"location":"blog/you_can_preserve_the_earth_s_livability_with_open_source/#demand-openness","title":"Demand openness","text":"<p>Environmental catastrophes are often accompanied by a cover-up and manipulation of scientific findings and information. This applies to climate change as well as local environmental impacts. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has given a clear warning following the release of the international climate change report, which shows no trend reversal in global warming and the loss of biodiversity in 2022.</p> <p>We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5\u00b0C limit agreed in Paris. Some government and business leaders are saying one thing, but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic. This is a climate emergency.</p> <p> </p>  Figure 7: With the help of pyam you can process the data behind the latest UN report and thus better understand the different scenarios. (pyam, Apache license)  <p>One of the easiest ways to change course is to consistently demand open science concerning environmental issues. Openness is a key indicator of sustainable development, because anyone pursuing truly sustainable intentions is interested in refining their conclusions through open scientific discourse. Openness will also help prevent greenwashing, or the practice of promoting a company's sustainability efforts through marketing while scientific findings and conclusions about environmental impacts are downplayed or held private.</p> <p>The next time you buy products that claim to be carbon neutral, ask for independent studies and data. If a politician demands questionable measures for environmental protection, ask for open model calculations and open access studies on this topic. Do you want to invest in a sustainable investment fund? Ask for open scientific studies, data, and models on why this investment is sustainable. Demanding openness in all these ways helps limit greenwashing and ensures that companies' environmental impacts are verifiable, accountable, and traceable.</p>"}]}
